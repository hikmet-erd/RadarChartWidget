# Core Refactoring & Optimization

## Main Plan
[Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250609194132_A3F7_plan_overview.md)

## Objective
Implement aggressive refactoring and optimization based on analysis findings to transform the Mendix radarChartWidget into a high-quality, maintainable codebase.

## Prerequisites
- Completed analysis report from previous sub-task
- Prioritized refactoring recommendations

## Scope
- Optimize algorithms and data handling in [src/RadarChartWidget.tsx](../../../src/RadarChartWidget.tsx)
- Refactor component architecture in [src/components/](../../../src/components/)
- Eliminate dead code and unused dependencies
- Enforce consistent naming conventions and code organization
- Implement robust error handling and performance optimizations
- Ensure Mendix widget best practices compliance

## Deliverables
1. Refactored and optimized source code
2. Updated TypeScript configurations and build setup
3. Performance improvements with measurable metrics
4. Clean, modular component architecture
5. Summary of changes with rationale

## Key Areas
- Algorithm optimization for chart rendering
- Memory usage and performance improvements
- Code modularity and reusability
- Error handling and edge case management
- Accessibility compliance implementation
