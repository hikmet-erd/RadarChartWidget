# Mendix Widget Complete Refactoring & Optimization - Plan Overview

## Overall Strategy
Execute a comprehensive 3-phase transformation of the radarChartWidget project from a poorly developed state to exemplary software engineering standards through systematic analysis, aggressive refactoring, and thorough documentation.

## Sub-tasks List

### Phase 1: Code Analysis & Assessment
**Task ID**: ROO#SUB_REFACTOR-ANALYSIS_S001_20250609194313_E8A2  
**Expert**: Rooroo Analyzer  
**Objective**: Perform deep codebase analysis to identify inefficiencies, dead code, anti-patterns, and optimization opportunities across all TypeScript/React source files.

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring & Optimization  
**Task ID**: ROO#SUB_REFACTOR-DEVELOP_S002_20250609194402_B9F1  
**Expert**: Rooroo Developer  
**Objective**: Implement aggressive refactoring based on analysis findings, including algorithm optimization, code modularization, dead code elimination, and performance improvements.

### Phase 3: Documentation & Final Polish
**Task ID**: ROO#SUB_REFACTOR-DOCUMENT_S003_20250609194429_C7D3  
**Expert**: Rooroo Documenter  
**Objective**: Create comprehensive JSDoc documentation, update project documentation, and apply final polish to achieve exemplary code quality standards.

## Key Dependencies
This plan follows a strictly sequential approach where:
- Phase 2 depends on completion of Phase 1 analysis findings
- Phase 3 depends on completion of Phase 2 refactored codebase
- Each phase builds upon the artifacts and insights from the previous phase

## Assumptions Made
- Current project structure is functional but poorly organized
- TypeScript/React codebase is the primary focus for refactoring
- Mendix widget development constraints must be preserved
- Existing functionality should be maintained while improving code quality
- Performance and accessibility improvements are critical requirements

## Potential Risks
- Aggressive refactoring may introduce regression bugs requiring thorough testing
- Mendix widget-specific constraints may limit some optimization approaches
- Large-scale code changes may impact build processes or dependencies
